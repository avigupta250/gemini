**Question 1:** Which layer in the TCP/IP model is responsible for routing data packets? (A) Application Layer (B) Network Layer (C) Transport Layer (D) Physical Layer **Answer: B** **Explanation:** The Network Layer is responsible for routing packets based on the destination IP addresses. **Question 2:** Which of the following is a type of network topology? (A) Bus (B) Ring (C) Star (D) All of the above **Answer: D** **Explanation:** Bus, ring, and star are all common network topologies that describe the way devices are connected to each other. **Question 3:** What is the purpose of a MAC address? (A) To identify a specific network interface (B) To route packets between networks (C) To provide a secure connection over the network (D) To assign IP addresses to devices **Answer: A** **Explanation:** A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to each network interface, used for identifying devices on a network. **Question 4:** Which of the following is a layer 4 protocol? (A) HTTP (B) IP (C) TCP (D) UDP **Answer: A & C** **Explanation:** HTTP and TCP are both layer 4 protocols, responsible for providing communication between applications and transporting data reliably. **Question 5:** What is the difference between a router and a switch? (A) Routers connect different networks, while switches connect devices within a network. (B) Switches connect different networks, while routers connect devices within a network. (C) Routers forward packets based on IP addresses, while switches forward packets based on MAC addresses. (D) Switches forward packets based on IP addresses, while routers forward packets based on MAC addresses. **Answer: C** **Explanation:** Routers operate at the Network Layer and forward packets based on IP addresses, while switches operate at the Data Link Layer and forward packets based on MAC addresses. **Question 6:** Which of the following is a type of cloud computing service model? (A) IaaS (B) SaaS (C) PaaS (D) All of the above **Answer: D** **Explanation:** IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service), and PaaS (Platform as a Service) are all cloud computing service models where resources are provided to customers over the internet. **Question 7:** What is the primary purpose of a firewall? (A) To prevent unauthorized access to a network (B) To improve network performance (C) To provide routing functionality (D) To store network data **Answer: A** **Explanation:** A firewall is a security device designed to protect a network from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. **Question 8:** Which of the following is a type of wireless network security protocol? (A) WEP (B) WPA (C) WPA2 (D) All of the above **Answer: D** **Explanation:** WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), and WPA2 are all wireless network security protocols designed to prevent unauthorized access and protect data. **Question 9:** What is the purpose of a VPN? (A) To create a private network connection over a public network (B) To enhance network performance (C) To provide routing functionality (D) To store network data **Answer: A** **Explanation:** A VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows users to securely access a private network remotely over a public network. **Question 10:** Which of the following is an advantage of network virtualization? (A) Improved flexibility (B) Cost savings (C) Increased security (D) All of the above **Answer: D** **Explanation:** Network virtualization allows for the creation of multiple virtual networks over a single physical network, providing improved flexibility, cost savings, and enhanced security`;
